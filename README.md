# Balearic Biodiversity Center

The **Balearic Biodiversity Centre** (CBB) is a scientific initiative that aims to generate knowledge about the biological diversity and the natural environment of the Balearic archipelago. Such information is crucial to establish management and conservation policies and to maintain the ecosystem services that biodiversity provides to society. The **CBB** is composed of a team of specialized researchers and technicians that can offer scientific - technical support for research groups, government managers, and the private sector, as well as to promote strategic collaborations, advice, and training on issues related to biodiversity.

## General Objectives

The main objective of the **CBB** is to strengthen the potential and capacity of the scientific community in the Balearic region, generating knowledge, collaborations and synergies. The **CBB** has state-of-the-art equipment for morphological, genetic and genomic studies, and holds collections of natural history and biodiversity data, together with a computing centre for powerful statistical and bioinformatics analyses. 

Special attention will be devoted to:
1. Generation, management and maintenance of reference natural history collections
2. Processing, sequencing and analysis of genomes and molecular markers
3. Generation, maintenance, management, and analysis of biodiversity data
4. Training of the scientific community and dissemination of information on biodiversity in the Balearic Islands.
